## Introduction

Metabokiller is a carcinogen-independent ensemble model for carcinogenicity prediction. It is a novel ensemble classifier that accurately recognizes carcinogens by quantitatively assessing their chemical composition as well as potential to induce proliferation, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, alterations in epigenetic signatures, and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways.<br/><br/>

## How to use Metabokiller?

To get predictions for your data:<br/>
Using jupyter notebook
- Download the **models** folder.<br/>
- Run the **MKEnsemble.ipynb** notebook.<br/>
- The input is a list of canonical SMILES (Openbabel generated) strings.<br/>

#Using pip package
- Installation 

```
pip install MetaboKiller

```

- Example

```
from MetaboKiller import mk_predictor as mk
```
```
# prepare a list of canonical SMILES (Openbabel generated) strings
smiles = ['ClCC=C', 'C=CCOC(=O)CC(C)C'] 
```
```
# run predictions on any of the carcinogenic property of interest (e.g. epigenetic modifications)
mk.Epigenetics(smiles)
```
```
# save the result as Pandas dataframe
result = mk.Epigenetics(smiles)
```
```
List of carcinogenic properties available in  **mk** 
mk.Epigenetics()
mk.Oxidative()
mk.GInstability()
mk.Electrophile()
mk.Proliferation()
mk.Apoptosis()
```

```
from MetaboKiller import EnsembleMK
```

```
# prepare a list of canonical SMILES (Openbabel generated) strings
smiles = ['ClCC=C', 'C=CCOC(=O)CC(C)C'] 
```
```
# run predictions for all available carcinogenic properties
EnsembleMK.predict(smiles)
```
```
# save the result as Pandas dataframe
result = EnsembleMK.predict(smiles)
```
```
# or get result explainability on individual carcinogenic properties for each SMILES 
result,explaination = EnsembleMK.predict(sa,explainability=True)
```


```
# getting output from explainability output object
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

```
pdf = PdfPages("Ensmble-Result.pdf")
for fig in explaination:
	fig.savefig(pdf, format='pdf')
pdf.close()
```
